        <p>Why buy the boxed stuff when you can make noodles at home? This homemade pasta recipe is way better than what you can buy at the store</p>
        <p>— and it’s surprisingly easy to throw together with just five ingredients you likely already have on hand!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups semolina flour</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>How to Make Pasta</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Sift all-purpose flour, semolina flour, and a pinch of salt together in a large bowl. Make a mountain out of flour mixture on a clean surface; create a deep well in the center. Break eggs into the well and add olive oil. Whisk eggs very gently with a fork, gradually incorporating flour from the sides of the well. When mixture becomes too thick to mix with a fork, begin kneading with your hands.</li>
            <li>Knead dough until it is smooth and supple, 8 to 12 minutes, Dust dough and work surface with semolina as needed to keep dough from becoming sticky. Wrap dough tightly in plastic wrap; allow it to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. </li>
            <li>Roll out dough with a pasta machine or a rolling pin to desired thickness. Cut into your favorite style of noodle or stuff with your favorite filling to make ravioli.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in the boiling water until tender yet firm to the bite, 1 to 3 minutes (or longer depending on thickness). Drain immediately and toss with your favorite sauce. </li>
        </ol>
